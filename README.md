## LeetCode##

Here is a list of problems on LeetCode I have solved so far. During the last few months, I studied and practiced  using python language and learned about algorithms, and it was a lot of fun!

I would gladly accept advice from others to improve my code and make it more efficient. Meanwhile, I will update my repository as I make progress. Please feel free to email me at taosha90@gmail.com. I'm looking forward to your opinion and advice.
